## Implementation
Instead of using the randomly generated maze I chose to make it myself. 

In terms of different materials I mostly used one, aluminum. I wanted a certain vibe of very unnatural and metallic. Made it feel like a prison or a dystopian experiment type thing. I also used the plastic material for the exit because it reflected the light the way I wanted it to. Then for the enemy I made a new material I called “shadow”. It’s a dark blue that is very smooth and reflective. It’s meant to be difficult to see in the dark but starkly reflect the light.

Speaking of light I have green and red spot lights. These are meant to show the way through the maze. I kind of wanted to do this subtle hinting at a story where maybe there’s someone or something trying to help you through the maze with these lights. At the end of the maze there is a “door” that leads to “outside”. It’s really a 3d game object that sends you to the end card that I used a point light to make look like it leads outside. I also used point lights to make sure the maze wasn’t pitch black because I wanted it dark but you still needed to be able to see. 

For the end card and main menu I drew something to imply the story. I’m not the best with making 3D games, or making games work well in general so I used art to better establish what was happening. 

I also made two different songs. One for the main menu and level, then one for the end card. The first is meant to be ominous and urgent while the later is supposed to be relief and I even included bird sounds to add to this feeling of escaping into the outside. 

A big focus was put on the story and vibes to try to make it cohesive through art and music. A lot of the little quirks of the game kinda help with the unsettling vibe I think.
